Introduction
This project implements a file compression and decompression system using Huffman Coding in C++ with a user-friendly interface. It efficiently reduces file size while preserving the original content and can be integrated with a web-based PHP frontend.

Features
File Compression: Reduces file size using Huffman encoding.
File Decompression: Restores the original file from compressed data.
Efficient Encoding: Uses Huffman trees for optimal bit representation.
User-Friendly Interface: Web-based interface using PHP for easy interaction.
Multi-File Support: Compresses and decompresses multiple files.
Secure Storage: Saves compressed files securely for download.
